# Switch Bulb Project

### A short and simple DOM application to understand the basis of correlation between HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

A simple DOM application using onclick functionality. The application allows you to turn a bulb on or off by clicking a button. It is made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. The main focus is on understanding how these three work together. An ample amount of comments are used throughout the code. 


## Getting Started

* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to view the website.
*Click the "Turn on" button to turn the bulb on or off.
